# Chandra does dotfiles

These dotfiles are to personalize my system. They have been evolving along with my software development skills.

I have been using them so far on Ubuntu and Mac OS X.

## Install

To install just dotfiles:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cnadiminti/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles/bin
./install_dotfiles.sh
```

To install dotfiles and more:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cnadiminti/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles/bin
./install.sh
```
